## Featured Projects

| **Validation of Pupil Labs’ Neon Head-Mounted Eye Tracking System for Human Behavioural Research** |
|---|
| **Tech:** Python, D-Lab, Neon Player  
Experimental validation study assessing the accuracy, precision, and reliability of the Pupil Labs Neon eye-tracking system for human behavioural research. The project evaluates calibration performance, gaze tracking consistency, and data quality across tasks, establishing suitability for use in controlled and applied research settings.  
**What I built:** Python AOI (Area of Interest) glance sorting pipelines (automated and manual)  
**Impact:** Improved glance analysis efficiency
