### Caffeine Intake Optimization & Fatigue Modeling
Mathematical and computational modeling project exploring the relationship between caffeine intake, metabolism, and fatigue over time. The project uses differential equations to model caffeine absorption and decay, and evaluates intake strategies to optimize alertness while minimizing negative effects.

- **Tech:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib  
- **What I built:** Mathematical fatigue model, ODE-based caffeine metabolism simulation, and visualization tools for comparing intake strategies  
- **Impact:** Enabled data-driven evaluation of caffeine timing and dosage to improve alertness modeling

### Bridge Design Project
Team-based structural engineering project focused on the design and analysis of a bridge system under realistic loading and constraint conditions. The project involved structural modeling, force analysis, and design trade-offs to ensure safety, efficiency, and feasibility.

- **Tech:** Engineering analysis, hand calculations, CAD / simulation tools  
- **What I built:** Structural design calculations, load analysis models, and supporting documentation for a complete bridge design  
- **Impact:** Delivered a structurally sound bridge design meeting safety and performance requirements

### YRSTF Fruit Ripeness Detector
Sensor-based detection project aimed at identifying fruit ripeness using measurable physical or chemical signals. The system processes sensor data to classify ripeness stages, supporting objective and repeatable assessment.

- **Tech:** Arduino  
- **What I built:** Data processing pipeline and classification logic for determining fruit ripeness from sensor measurements  
- **Impact:** Demonstrated a low-cost, automated approach to fruit ripeness detection
